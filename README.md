# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data

# Course Project
  Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

 -Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
 
 -Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
 
 -Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 
 -Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
 
 -From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
